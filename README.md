# rdfsearch

rdfsearch is a small Python utility which can index up RDF files with
the Whoosh search engine, and then provides a simple search interface
on top of the data. rdfsearch should eventually be able to search any
RDF, through annotations on the RDF vocabulary, but at the moment it's
fairly simple.

More documentation will be coming once the software has matured a
little.
